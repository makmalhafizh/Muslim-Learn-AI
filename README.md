# Muslim-Learn-AI
Muslim Learn AI is an experimental project to develop an AI-driven platform for Muslims to learn Islam from verified classical texts. It leverages lightweight LLMs (4Bâ€“14B), GGUF model fine-tuning, RAG (via AnythingLLM, LM Studio, Docker), and automation with n8n to explore accessible and accurate Islamic education solutions.
