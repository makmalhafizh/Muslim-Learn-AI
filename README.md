# ☪️Muslim-Learn-AI
Muslim Learn AI is an experimental project to develop an AI-driven platform for Muslims to learn Islam from verified classical texts. It leverages lightweight LLMs (4B–14B), GGUF model fine-tuning, RAG (via AnythingLLM, LM Studio, Docker), and automation with n8n to explore accessible and accurate Islamic education solutions.

### ⌛History of The Experimentation
  1. Local RAG (via AnythingLLM, LM Studio, Docker) - **Done**
  2. GGUF model fine-tuning (using various base LLMs between 4B–14B) - **Done**
  3. Automation with n8n and specified RAG data - **Recent**

**❗DISCLAIMER** _This project is an experimental learning journey and reflects my self-taught exploration in AI and Islamic knowledge integration. The approaches and implementations may contain errors or inaccuracies as I continuously learn and improve. I greatly appreciate any feedback, corrections, and shared knowledge from the community to help refine this work._
